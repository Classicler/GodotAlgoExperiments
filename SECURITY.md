## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If a vulnerability is found, first check to make sure that it is not listed in UPDATES.md. If it is listed there, that means the vulnerability you reported has already been reported,
accepted, and is being resolved currently.

If the vulnerabilty is not posted in UPDATES.md, you can create an issue on Github explaining the vulnerability. You vulnerability may be declined 
if the owner does not think that the reported vulnerability is a vulnerability. Updates regarding vulnerabilities and other things in this repository will be posted in 
UPDATES.md as they are being resolved.
