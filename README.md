# GodotAlgoExperiments
A repository for the experimentation of Algorithms in the Godot game engine

# Most Recent Version: 1.0-beta.0.0
## About
Godot is a free, open source game engine, allowing for many opportunities for the community to help contribute to it. GodotAlgoExperiments uses the Godot game engine to test
various algorithms, like the Shunting Yard Algorithm for properly calculating a math expression from a String data type.

## Algorithms Added by Repository Version
### Version 1.0-beta.0.0
**Shunting Yard** -- used to parse mathematical expressions from infix notation to postfix notation
