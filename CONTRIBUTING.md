# Contributing to Our Project
For the people that are willing to participate in contributing to our project, thank you for taking some time out your day to do it!  

## When contributing here, there are certain guidelines to follow for effective contributing:
* ### When creating a pull request, detail EVERY change you made and tag what type of changes took place
  If in a branch you make edits and submit a pull request containing those edits, it is important to detail all of your changes. For example, if you simplified some code, which
  file/s was/were simplified? What parts of the code (functions, variables, etc.) did you manage to simplify? It is easier to review changes if we know precisely where they are.  
  While creating a pull request, you also need to specify what type/s of change/s was/were made by using tags. When creating a pull request, you can choose tags on the sidebar
  that shows up.
* ### When creating an issue, specify it in as much detail as possible.  
  Issues need to be specified in detail so that everyone clearly knows that your issue is about and therefore it is easier to come up with a solution.
